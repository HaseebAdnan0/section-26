extract all the files, then run these commands in a terminal(preferably git bash). You must have node js and npm(included in node standard installation) installed:


make sure your terminal is looking for files in the folder "section-26", like this: ![image](https://github.com/HaseebAdnan0/section-26/assets/160724139/506735e4-1a5c-464c-9c38-104d0041c42a)

npm i
this command installs all the packages

node index.js

lastly, open up your localhost at port 3000

http://localhost:3000


This is somewhat how your git bash should look like:

First command "cd d:/" goes to D Drive, this might not be necessary.
second command "ls" lists all the folders and files located where you are.
third command goes to the where section 26 is located, this will be different for you. (Tip, partly type the name of the folder and press tab to see if you get autocompletion, it's a good indicator of being in the right directory)
4th command "npm i" installs all the dependencies
5th command "node index.js" runs the web app on your machine
