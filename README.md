extract all the files, then run these commands in a terminal. You must have node js and npm(included in node standard installation) installed:

make sure your terminal is looking for files in the folder "section-26", like this: ![image](https://github.com/HaseebAdnan0/section-26/assets/160724139/506735e4-1a5c-464c-9c38-104d0041c42a)

npm i
this command installs all the packages

node index.js

lastly, open up your localhost at port 3000

http://localhost:3000
